This is coding and original datasets from AMADEUS and KLEMS for my dissertation.

I recommend you to download datasets and Coding.Rmd and run in your R studio.
There are a few warnings in coding, when I used a function "melt", I did not set particular Id variables and measure variables.
It works fine and produces outcome that I wanted.

To briefly explain it,

The aim of this research is to evaluate the relationship between labour share of income and market concentration in the context of the French economy.

This is already submitted and graded as the first class result.
